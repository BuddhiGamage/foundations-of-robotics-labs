These Python Jupyter notebooks are designed for academic teaching laboratories in robotics, using Gazebo for simulation up to physical deployment on robotic platforms. The students are not expected to install or deploy the required ROS workspace on their personal computer, but rather use lab resources at the university. The laboratories were designed at École de technologie supérieure, in Montréal, Canada, and adapted for the University of Canberra. Robotic platforms are available for the students to test their algorithms along with shared laptop stations.

## Prerequisites

The notebooks are designed to be used with a ROS workspace that contains the following packages:

- [Sphero RVR ROS](<https://github.com/CollaborativeRoboticsLab/sphero_rvr_ros>) - ROS packages for the Sphero RVR
- [Kinova Gen3 lite ROS](<https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/ros_kortex>) - ROS packages for the Kinova Gen3 lite

## Projects

- [**Project 0 - Primers**](<./1-foundations/0-primers/readme.md>) - Primers on Python, the terminal, and ROS
- [**Project 1 - Sense -> Think -> Act**](<./1-foundations/1-sense-think-act/readme.md>) - Feedback & Robotic algorithm fundamentals
- [**Project 2 - Perception, Filters, and Navigation**](<./2-mobile-robots/2-navigation/readme.md>) - Localization, Navigation & Mapping
- [**Project 3 - Kinematics**](<./2-robot-manipulation/3-kinematics/readme.md>) - Kinematics for a Robot Manipulator
- [**Project 4 - Algorithms**](<./4-algorithms/readme.md>) - Algorithms for Robotics

## Installation

### ROS

The software requires ROS to be installed to use the `rospy` libraries. Follow the instructions for ROS `Noetic` on the [official website](https://ros.org).

### Virtual Environment

Setting up a python virtual environment for can be useful in some development situations. Run the following command in a terminal at the top level of this git repository.

```python
# create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# linux
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the code

The code is provided as [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org). In a terminal at the top level of this git repository, run the following.

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate

# start a jupyter notebook server
jupyter lab --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888
# open a web browser to the address provided in the terminal
# for example: http://localhost:8888/lab?token=...

# or run a voila server for the UI only version
voila . --port=8866
```

### Docker

A Dockerfile is provided to run the notebooks in a container. To build the container, run the following command in a terminal at the top level of this git repository.

```bash
# build the docker container
docker build -t frlab -f .binder/Dockerfile .

# run the docker container
docker run -p 8888:8888 frlab jupyter lab --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888
```
