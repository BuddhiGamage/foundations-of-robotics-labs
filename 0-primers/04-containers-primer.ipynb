This allows you to run code in a consistent environment, regardless of what machine you are running it on. This is especially useful when you are working in a team, as it allows you to ensure that everyone is running the same code in the same environment."

It is like a small virtual computer that you can run on your computer. It is similar to a [virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine), but it is much more lightweight. It is also similar to a python virtual environment, but it can be used for any programming language."

                "In robotics development, we often have to deal with a lot of dependencies. For example, we may have to install ROS, OpenCV, and other libraries. We may also have to install drivers for our sensors and actuators. This can be a lot of work, and it can be difficult to ensure that the computer onboard a robot has the same environment as the computer we are developing on. Containers allow us to package all of these dependencies together, and run them in a consistent environment. "
